Polynomial-multiplication-using-divide-and-conquer-and-its-analysis
===================================================================

This project contains three approaches to solve a polynomial multiplication of 2^n coefficients and they are 1) recursive approach 2) four sub problems approach 3) three sub problem approach. 2nd and 3rd approach uses divide and conquer mechanism

The java program files are named as basicPolynomialMultiplication, fourSubProblemQM, threeSubProblemQM for 
school book approach, four sub problems divide and conquer approach and three sub problems divide and conquer approach respectively. The execution
time is calculated by the Profiling tool provided by the NetBeans IDE 7.4. These values are plotted 
in the graph. You can change the number of coefficients in all the programs. The code is easily customizable.

school book approach graph:
--------------------------------------------------------
This graph is made in MS Excel. The x-axis is the "log of no. of coefficient" and y-axis is the "log of execution time in 
milliseconds". 

--------------------------------------------------------
four sub problems divide and conquer approach graph:
--------------------------------------------------------
This graph is made in MS Excel. The x-axis is the "log of no. of coefficient" and y-axis is the "log of execution time in 
milliseconds". It can solve for only 2^n number of coefficients with 1<=n

--------------------------------------------------------
three sub problems divide and conquer Approach graph:
--------------------------------------------------------
This graph is made in MS Excel. The x-axis is the "log of no. of coefficient" and y-axis is the "log of execution time in 
milliseconds". It can solve for only 2^n number of coefficients with 1<=n
