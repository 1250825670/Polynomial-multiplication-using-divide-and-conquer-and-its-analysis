Polynomial-multiplication-using-divide-and-conquer-and-its-analysis
===================================================================

This project contains three approaches to solve a polynomial multiplication of 2^n coefficients and they are 1) recursive approach 2) four sub problems approach 3) three sub problem approach. 2nd and 3rd approach uses divide and conquer mechanism
